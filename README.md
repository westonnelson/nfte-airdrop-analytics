# nfte-airdrop-analytics

The NFTEarth project was built out of the desire to expand access to non-fungible technology to as many people across Earth as possible, focusing on Layer2 scaling solutions. 


This repository is for sharing highlights from the NFTE token onchain airdrop data (the original token, not LayerZero OFT).

By most conventional standards, the NFTE airdrop was an unusually successful airdrop campaign, with 1,689 total addresses (94% of eligible addresses) claiming their tokens. 

The Airdrop contract address can be viewed on [Optimistic Etherscan here](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xfa1c8cd6b3a5ead9499b8d09f9747c4068f88f37 )
